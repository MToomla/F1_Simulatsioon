# Racing Results Analyzer

The Racing Results Analyzer is a Python script that analyzes racing results data and provides insights such as total lap times, sector best times, lap time differences, and mistakes made by racers. It takes input from a file in a specific format and generates a report with the analyzed results.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3 or above).
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Prepare the racing results data in a file named `Result.txt`. The file should follow a specific format (see next section).
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the cloned/downloaded directory.
5. Run the script by executing the following command:
   ```shell
   python analyzer.py
6. The script will read the data from the Result.txt file and generate a report with the analyzed results. 
Data Format
The input file Result.txt should follow the following format:
Lap;Name;Lap Time;Sector 1;Sector 2;Sector 3;Error
1;John Doe;75.28;23.42;26.18;25.68;False
2;Jane Smith;74.91;23.05;26.48;25.38;False
...
Each line represents a lap with the lap number, racer name, lap time, sector times, and an error flag.
Features
The Racing Results Analyzer provides the following features:

Calculation of total lap times for each racer.
Identification of racers with the fastest times in each sector.
Calculation of lap time differences between each racer and the first-place racer.
Detection of mistakes made by racers during the race.
Display of the best lap time achieved and the racer who achieved it.
Example Output
Below is an example output generated by the script:

Racer       Total Time    Mistakes       Difference
---------------------------------------------------
John Doe    02:28:45      [3, 7]        +00:00:00
Jane Smith  02:29:01                   +00:00:16
...
Best Lap Time: John Doe - 01:20:32

Sector Best Times:
Sector 1: John Doe - 00:23:42
Sector 2: Jane Smith - 00:26:18
Sector 3: John Doe - 00:25:68

Combined Best Time: 01:15:28
